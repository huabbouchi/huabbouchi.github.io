## <a name="C1">Introduction</a>

I am a Data Scientist at a financial company called **"Prêt à dépenser"**, which provides consumer loans to individuals with little or no credit history.

The company aims to implement a **credit scoring tool** to calculate the probability that a customer will repay their loan and classify loan applications as approved or declined. Therefore, it intends to develop a **classification algorithm** based on various data sources (behavioral data, data from other financial institutions, etc.).<br>
In addition, customer relationship managers have highlighted the fact that customers increasingly seek transparency regarding credit approval decisions. This customer demand for transparency aligns with the values the company wants to embody.<br>
Hence, Ready to Spend decides to develop **an interactive dashboard** to enable relationship managers to explain credit approval decisions as transparently as possible and also allow customers to access and explore their personal information easily.

### <a name="C1.1">Mission:</a> 

1. Build a scoring model that will provide an automatic prediction of a customer's likelihood of default.
2. Create an interactive dashboard for relationship managers to interpret the model's predictions and enhance their understanding of customer profiles.

***

### <a name="C1.2">Dashboard Specifications:</a> 

* Allow visualization of the score and its interpretation for each customer in a way that is understandable to someone who is not a data science expert.
* Enable the visualization of descriptive information for a customer (via a filtering system).
* Allow comparison of descriptive information for a customer with that of all customers or a similar group of customers.
